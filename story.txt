Once upon a time there was a little octopus named Oscar, and a fluffy penugin named Penny. Oscar and Penny were best friends who did everything together - school, soccer, and lots of adventures! They lived together in the North Pole, and longed one day to meet the mysterious Santa Claus. They had it pretty nice up in the North Pole, plenty of snow to play in, and lots of water for Oscar to swim around in. Oscar could hold his breath a lot longer than Penny, but they could still go on long swimming adventures. Swimming was thier favorite, and the arctic ocean was a wonderful place to find food and other friends.
Still they longed to meet Santa Claus. They had even heard there were mini men and women who followed Santa around and did his bidding. Oscar had heard a rumor at school that one of the mini men had been sighted not far from their favorite soccer field. Oscar excitedly told Penny what he'd heard at lunch and it was decided. They would set out this very afternoon! They'd begin the quest to find Santa.
On the journey they left, skipping excitedly into the land beyond the schoolgrounds. Once they got passed the soccer fields sneakily, they took off running towards a cluster of towering glaciers. After a long half-hour of walking, Penny wanted to head back, but Oscar was determined. They continued walking, when they heard a muffled gasp in the distance.
Sure enough, it was one of the mini people, or so Oscar assumed. Penny thought so too but was a bit more skeptical. How could she really know how someone she'd never seen would look?
