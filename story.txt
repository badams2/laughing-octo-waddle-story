Once upon a time there was a little octopus named Oscar, and a fluffy penugin named Penny. Oscar and Penny were best friends who did everything together - school, soccer, and lots of adventures! They lived together in the North Pole, and longed one day to meet the mysterious Santa Claus. They had it pretty nice up in the North Pole, plenty of snow to play in, and lots of water for Oscar to swim around in. Oscar could hold his breath a lot longer than Penny, but they could still go on long swimming adventures. Swimming was thier favorite, and the arctic ocean was a wonderful place to find food and other friends.
